# Summary
This living repo is meant to serve as a collection of resources for self-learning about Blockchain. It features a general curriculum to help guide you with what you should be learning about.

## About me
I've been interested in Blockchain technology ever since I heard about it when it was making news for shattering record highs in late 2013. I was intrigued but focused on other things until the launch of Ethereum, then followed it casually. In 2017, when I had just started working full time for Uber in San Francisco, I followed it much more closely and began diving deeper into the technology. At the beginning of 2018, I decided to jump into the deep end and take the path to becoming a skilled Blockchain engineer.

I've been making notes of the excellent resources I've come across while learning. I'm aggregating them here in hopes that you can benefit from them too.

Good luck!

# Prerequisites
Anyone with a Computer Science degree is more than ready.
Anyone with moderate programming knowledge and basic cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashes, etc) is ready

# Curriculum

## Overview of crypto
This section is for a basic overview of the blockchain space. Skip this if you already know about it.

## Bitcoin
- Not everyone is expected to read through the whitepaper, but it can only help you understand more deeply. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
- One of the best demos: https://blockchaindemo.io/ Just click start demo in the top right corner.

## Ethereum
Ethereum has the most mindshare when it comes to blockchain platforms. It was the first ans is by far the most advanced platform and has the most developed resources. Other blockchain platforms like Cardano or Neo will improve and may eat into the mindshare, but for now we will focus mostly on Ethereum.

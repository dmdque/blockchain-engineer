# Summary
This living repo is meant to serve as a collection of resources for self-learning about Blockchain. It features a general curriculum to help guide you with what you should be learning about.

# Prerequisites
Anyone with a Computer Science degree is more than ready.
Anyone with moderate programming knowledge and basic cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashes, etc) is ready

# Curriculum

## Overview of crypto
This section is for a basic overview of the Blockchain space. Skip this if you already know about it.
- Browse this [list of crypto projects TLDRs](https://github.com/dmdque/crypto-tldr)

## Bitcoin
- Not everyone is expected to read through the whitepaper, but it can only help you understand more deeply. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
- One of the best demos: https://blockchaindemo.io/ Just click start demo in the top right corner.

## Ethereum
Ethereum has the most mind share when it comes to blockchain platforms. It was the first and is by far the most advanced platform and has the most developed resources. Other Blockchain platforms like Cardano or Neo will improve and may eat into the mind share, but for now we will focus mostly on Ethereum.

### Solidity
- [Introductory tutorial and reference](https://github.com/nemild/learnxinyminutes-docs/blob/update-to-latest-solidity/solidity.html.markdown)
- https://cryptozombies.io

- [Solidity by Example](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example)

### Read the Docs
Solidity has strong documentation on [Read the Docs](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but it's a lot to take in all at once.

Here are the ones you should read as you develop an intermediate level:
